## Overview

The National Timing Windows Database is a structured relational database designed to integrate diverse ecological datasets relevant to the identification of optimal timing windows for human interventions in Canadian waterbodies. The database consolidates spatial, taxonomic, phenological, and ecological trait data into a unified format to support environmental assessments, conservation efforts, and policy decisions.

The database is built using SQLite and adheres to a structured schema that maintains referential integrity and optimized data retrieval. Key datasets include species distributions, fish traits, waterbody characteristics, and species phenology.

## Core Data Tables

### 1. Watersheds (`watersheds`)

- Description: Contains attributes describing hydrological watershed units.
- Primary Key: `watershed_id`
- Key Fields:
  - `watershed_id`: Unique identifier for each watershed.
  - `name`: Watershed name.
  - `area_km2`: Watershed area in square kilometers.
  
### 2. Waterbodies (`waterbodies`)

- Description: Stores geospatial data on lakes and rivers across Canada.
- Primary Key: `waterbody_id`
- Key Fields:
  - `waterbody_id`: Unique identifier for each waterbody.
  - `name`: Waterbody name.
  - `type`: Classification (lake, river, etc.).

## Summary

The National Timing Windows Database provides a structured, relational framework for integrating and analyzing fish species data across Canadian waterbodies. The inclusion of spatial, ecological, and temporal attributes ensures that researchers and conservation practitioners can assess seasonal constraints on fish life processes, ultimately supporting science-based conservation and management decisions.
