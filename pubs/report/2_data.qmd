The [Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board (C-NLOPB)](https://www.cnlopb.ca/) [@citation] oversees and provides data on offshore petroleum activities in Newfoundland. This dataset includes multiple files covering exploration and production licenses, various well data, call for bids, land tenure sectors of the Scheduled Land Tenure System, and well info summaries (@tbl-offshore-petroleum-nfl), providing a comprehensive view of the offshore petroleum landscape in Newfoundland. The dataset includes both spatial and tabular data. Key variables encompass license IDs, well IDs, geographic coordinates, vessel types, exploration phases, and parcel identifiers. Data files are provided in various formats, including shapefiles and Excel files, and have been processed to create spatial representations of offshore petroleum activity sites. For the purpose of this project, we only retained, if available, the classification, status, start and end dates when processing the data. The different categories of offshore petroleum activities are detailed in @tbl-classifications. Each entry in the integrated dataset was given a unique identifiers. Individual entries with dual classification (e.g. exploration and delineation) were duplicated, each retaining the same id to avoid overestimating the number of entries in the dataset. As such, the number of unique entries would correspond to the number of unique identifiers rather than the number of rows in the dataset. For data with well status, we simplified status categories for the processed data, which are detailed in @tbl-status. How date ranges were established for each entry is detailed in @tbl-offshore-petroleum-nfl.

    "Offshore areas in Newfoundland and Labrador that are currently licensed for petroleum exploration. An Exploration License (EL) grants rights to conduct exploratory drilling and other activities aimed at discovering petroleum resources within a designated offshore area. These licenses are typically issued for a fixed period, encouraging exploration activities that assess the resource potential in Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore regions.",
    "Offshore areas within Newfoundland and Labrador where significant petroleum discoveries have been identified and are actively licensed. An Active Significant Discovery License (SDL) allows the holder to retain rights over a discovery area with proven, potentially commercial quantities of petroleum, preserving the right to future exploration and development.",
    "Offshore areas in Newfoundland and Labrador where petroleum resources are actively being produced. A Production License (PL) authorizes the holder to extract petroleum within a specified offshore area, following proven resource discoveries. This license allows companies to conduct production activities while adhering to regulatory requirements for resource management, environmental protection, and safety.",
    "Locations of offshore production installations used in petroleum extraction activities in Newfoundland and Labradorâ€™s offshore areas. A Production Installation refers to infrastructure such as platforms, rigs, or other facilities designed to extract, process, and transport petroleum resources from beneath the seafloor. These installations play a critical role in supporting production operations within licensed areas.",
    "Locations of delineation wells drilled in offshore areas of Newfoundland and Labrador. A Delineation Well is drilled to determine the extent and characteristics of a known petroleum discovery, helping to assess the size, quality, and commercial viability of the resource. These wells are essential in refining the understanding of hydrocarbon deposits discovered by exploration wells.",
    "Locations of development wells in offshore areas of Newfoundland and Labrador. Development Wells are drilled within proven petroleum fields to facilitate resource extraction. These wells are strategically placed to optimize production from known hydrocarbon deposits, making them critical for efficient and sustainable petroleum extraction.",
    "Offshore wells in Newfoundland and Labrador that have been classified under more than one category during their lifecycle. Dual Classified Wells may serve multiple purposes, such as transitioning from an exploration role to development or delineation, depending on the results of drilling and assessments. This dual classification reflects the adaptive approach taken in offshore petroleum exploration and production.",
    "Locations of offshore wells in Newfoundland and Labrador that are designated for exploration. Exploration Wells are drilled to investigate potential petroleum deposits in unexplored or underexplored areas. These wells are the first step in assessing hydrocarbon presence and play a crucial role in determining the viability of further development.",
